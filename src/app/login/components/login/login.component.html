      Never have trouble deciding what to read next.
      Reader reviews can run the gambit. The same
      book could be called "the best book of all time"
      by one reviewer and "total trash" by another.
      How do you wade through the muck and find
      something you are confident you will enjoy?
      NEXT matches you with other people who share
      your taste in books and makes recommendations
      based on what else they find entertaining.
