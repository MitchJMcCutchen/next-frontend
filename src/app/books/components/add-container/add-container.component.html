    The more books you add the better, so it's a good idea
    to go through your bookshelf at home and add them all!
    Or just a few. Whatever, it's up to you.
  </p>
  <p class="tutorial step-2" *ngIf="state === 'show'">
    The first book you add is probably one of
    your favorites. That's great! For the best
    recommendations, your shelf should include
    at least a few books you didn't care for as
    well. But that can come later.
  </p>
  <p class="tutorial step-3" *ngIf="state === 'add' && (currentStep$ | async) === 'plot'">
    No more ambiguous 5 stars!
    We'll give you 5 categories, you decide
    if you liked each one or note. Easy, right?
  </p>
  <p class="tutorial step-4" *ngIf="state === 'add' && (currentStep$ | async) === 'complete'">
    Once you add a book to your shelf we can use your thoughts
    on each category to match you up with people who felt the
    same way.
